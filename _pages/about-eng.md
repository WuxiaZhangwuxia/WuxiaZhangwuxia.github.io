PhD, Associate Professor, Supervisor of Master Students. Member of CSIG Imaging Detection and Sensing Committee, CSIG Women's Working Committee, Chinese Graphics and Image Society, Chinese Electronic Education Society, China Computer Federation, and IEEE Member. From July 2012 to July 2016, worked as a software engineer in Huawei Technologies Co., Ltd., engaging in the development of Huawei Cloud-related software. In June 2019, obtained a PhD in Signal and Information Processing from the University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, and joined the School of Computer Science, Xi'an University of Posts and Telecommunications in July of the same year, carrying out teaching and research work in the fields of remote sensing image target detection and recognition, and machine learning.

She has presided over 1 National Natural Science Foundation General Project, 1 Youth Project, 1 Key R&D Project of Shaanxi Province, 1 Special Project of Shaanxi Provincial Department of Education, 1 Open Fund Project of Key Laboratory, and more than 10 horizontal projects. As a main participant, she has participated in multiple projects such as the National Natural Science Foundation Distinguished Youth Project, General Project, State Administration of Science, Technology and Industry for National Defense Project, and CAS Top Talent Project.

In recent years, she has published more than 30 academic papers in authoritative journals in the field such as TGRS, IJAEOG, GRSL, RS, and CVIU, and applied for and authorized more than 10 invention patents. She serves as a reviewer for multiple authoritative journals in the field of remote sensing, and was awarded the "Outstanding Reviewer" title of Neurocomputing in 2018 and 2020, as well as a young scientific editor of the Journal of Xi'an University of Posts and Telecommunications. She was awarded the title of "Excellent Supervisor of Xi'an University of Posts and Telecommunications in 2025".

Graduate students under her guidance have won national scholarships, Xi'an University of Posts and Telecommunications graduate innovation projects, electronic design competitions, computer design competitions, data modeling and other awards, as well as school excellent graduates. She has established long-term and in-depth exchanges and cooperation with computer vision research teams from Northwestern Polytechnical University, Xidian University, Chang'an University, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Rensselaer Polytechnic University, and target detection and recognition teams from many companies such as Huawei.
